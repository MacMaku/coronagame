## What problem your idea solves:

From the global perspective one of the weakest points of the humanity on the war against the Coronavirus is the human ignorance. Many young and healthy people around the world feel confident to survive potential virus symptoms. They treat national-wide quarantines as an extra holidays. Their ignorance helps spreading the virus and creates potential threat to other people, who are more vulnerable (older, in serious condition or just without access to a high quality health care). Our idea is to use the interactive storytelling experience to force people to open their eyes by visualizing the not always obvious facts about virus spreading model and forcing to realize that their ignorance is the problem of all humanity and their mindless actions can lead to very serious consequences.

## Objective results:

Instead of solving the consequences of the Coronavirus, we like to focus people on the fact that every action has a reaction and their personal choices matters. W think that it's better to prevent than cure so we want to reduce the scale of the overal damages by slowing down the speed of spreading the virus. The more time we'll have, the less we'll have to sacrifice.


## Scale of impact:
- increasing the awareness of the potential consequences of ignoring the quarantine
- encouraging people to think about others
- providing confirmed data about the virus
- reducing people who participate unconciously in spreading the virus
- slowing down the speed of spreading the virus
- giving more time to react
- reducing the potential damages to the people and global economy
- potential for the global social media movement fighting with the ignorance of the significant part of the humanity
